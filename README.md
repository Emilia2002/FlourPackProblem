# FlourPackProblem
The problem shows if it is possible to make a package with goal kilos of flour. The parameter bigCount represents the count of big flour bags (5 kilos each) and smallCount represents the count of small flour bags (1 kilo each). The sum of bigCount and smallCount should be at least equal to the value of goal.
